# SMTShell-API Implementation Validation Checklist

## Core Implementation ✅
- [x] Replaced Samsung SMTShell service with direct root access
- [x] Added `isRootAvailable()` method to check root access
- [x] Added `requestRootAccess()` method with callback interface
- [x] Modified `executeCommand()` to use `su -c 'command'`
- [x] Modified `loadLibrary()` to use root execution
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility with existing API surface

## Permission System ✅
- [x] Added `android.permission.ACCESS_SUPERUSER` to manifests
- [x] Kept legacy permissions for backward compatibility
- [x] Updated permission constants in API

## Sample Application ✅
- [x] Created complete Android app in `app/` module
- [x] Implemented root permission request UI
- [x] Added command execution demonstration
- [x] Proper error handling and user feedback

## Build & CI/CD ✅
- [x] Updated Gradle configuration for modern Android build tools
- [x] Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated building
- [x] Added APK and AAR artifact publishing
- [x] Support for both debug and release builds

## Documentation ✅
- [x] Updated README with new root-based approach
- [x] Added migration guide from v1.x
- [x] Documented new API methods
- [x] Added usage examples

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Manual testing on rooted device required
- [ ] Verify root permission request dialog appears
- [ ] Test command execution with proper stdout/stderr capture
- [ ] Test library loading functionality
- [ ] Verify error handling for non-rooted devices

## Expected Behavior on Rooted Device:
1. App checks root availability using `isRootAvailable()`
2. User taps "Request Root Access" - SuperSU/Magisk dialog appears
3. After granting permission, "Execute Test Command" becomes enabled
4. Command execution shows root user info (uid=0)

## Files Modified/Created:
- `api/src/main/java/net/blufenix/smtshell/api/SMTShellAPI.java` - Core implementation
- `api/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added root permissions
- `app/` - Complete sample application
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
- `README.md` - Updated documentation
- `test_build.sh` - Build validation script

## Verification Commands:
```bash
# Build everything
./gradlew build

# Create APKs
./gradlew assembleDebug assembleRelease

# Run validation script
./test_build.sh
```

## Device Requirements:
- Android 7.0+ (API 24+)
- Rooted device with SuperSU, Magisk, or similar
- Root management app must be configured to grant permissions
